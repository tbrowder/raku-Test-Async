=NAME

C<Test::Async::Result> - test result representation

=SYNOPSIS

    self.proclaim: test-result(
                        $condition, 
                        fail => {
                            comments => "a comment about the cause of flunk",
                        });

=DESCRIPTION

This class represents information about test outcomes.

=ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<Bool:D $.cond>

I<True> if test is considered success, I<False> otherwise. B<Note> that a skipped tests is a success.

=head2 C<$.fail-profile>, C<$.success-profile>

Profile to be used to create a new C<Event::Test> object depending on C<$.cond> value either C<success-> or
C<fail-profile> is used. The most typical use of this is to add comments explaining the test outcome.

=METHODS

=head2 C<event-profile()>

Returns a profile accordingly to C<$.cond>.
