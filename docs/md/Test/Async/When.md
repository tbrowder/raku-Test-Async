NAME
====



`Test::Async::When` - add `:when` key to plan

SYNOPSIS
========



Whole top suite:

    use Test::Async <When Base>;
    plan :when(<release>);

Or a subtest only:

    use Test::Async <When Base>;
    subtest "Might be skipped" => {
        plan :when(
                :all(
                    :any(<release author>),
                    :module<Optional::Module>));
        ...
    }

}

DESCRIPTION
===========



This bundle extends `plan` with additional parameter `:when` which defines when the suite is to be actually ran. If `when` condition is not fulfilled the suite is skipped. The condition is a nested combination of keys and values:

  * a string value means a name of a testing mode enabled with an environment variable. Simply put, it gets uppercased, appended with *_TESTING* and the resulting name is checked against `%*ENV`. If the string is already ending with *_TESTING* it is used as-is.

  * a pair with `env` key tests for a environment variable. The variable name is used as-is, with no manipulations done to it.

  * a pair with `module` key tests if a module with the given name is available

  * a pair with keys `any` or `all` basically means that either any of it subcondition or all of them are to be fulfilled

  * a pair with `none` key means all of its sunconditions must fail.

By default the topmost condition means `any`, so that the following two statements are actually check the same condition:

    plan :when<release author>;
    plan :when(:any<release author>);
