=head1 NAME

C<Test::Async::Event> – collection of standard events

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Async::Event;

    test-bundle MyBundle {
        method foo(Str:D $message) is test-tool {
            self.send-test: Event::Ok, :$message
        }
    }

=DESCRIPTION

General information about C<Test::Async> event management can be found in
L<C<Test::Async::Manual>|Manual.md>.

Events are objects of classes derived from C<Event> class. This module provides support for C<Test::Async> core. In
general, all event classes can be conventionally split into the following groups:

=item I<informative> – events signalling about some state changes. Like, for example, suite termination.
=item I<reporting> - events bearing a message to be reported to user.
=item I<commands> – those which tell the core to perform an action.
=item I<tests> – outcomes of individual test tools.

=head2 Class C<Event>

The base event class.

=head3 Attributes

=item C<$.origin> – event originating object. Defaults to the current test suite object.
=item C<Int:D $.id> – event id, a sequential number.
=item C<Instant:D $.time> – the moment when event object was created.

=head3 Methods

=item C<Profile> – returns a L<C<Map>|https://docs.raku.org/type/Map> suitable for passing to an event constructor. The
method collects all changed public attributes of an object.
=item C<gist>, C<Str> – stringify event object for reporting.

and possibly other modules. The set of command events is not standartized and subject for changes.
