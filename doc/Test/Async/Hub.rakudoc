=head1 NAME

C<Test::Async::Hub> - the core of C<Test::Async> framework

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>
if test-suite.random {
    say "The current suite is in random mode"
}
=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Consumes L<C<Test::Async::Aggregator>|rakudoc:Test::Async::Aggregator>,
L<C<Test::Async::JobMgr>|rakudoc:Test::Async::JobMgr>

See L<C<Test::Async::Manual>|rakudoc:Test::Async::Manual>
for general purpose of this class.

=head2 Command Execution

All events whose class derives from C<Event::Command> are handled in a special manner. Class name of such event is used
to form a method name. Corresponding method is then invoked with a L<C<Capture>|https://docs.raku.org/type/Capture>
passed in event's attribute C<$.args>.  For example, to mark all remaining tests as skipped, event
C<Event::Cmd::SkipRemaining> is used. Based on the class, method C<cmd-skipremaining> is invoked with a single
positional string argument in C<$.args> containing the skip message if the event has been created without an error.

Method C<send-command> is recommended to emit command messages.

See method C<set-todo> or C<sync-events> for an example of using this interface.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<parent-suite>

If defined then it's the suite which invoked the current one.

=head2 C<message>

Message associated with this suite. Only makes sense for children.

=head2 C<code>

The code block associated with the suite. Undefined for the top one.

=head2 C<completed>

A L<C<Promise>|https://docs.raku.org/type/Promise> instance which is fulfilled when C<done-testing> is executed.

=head2 C<planned>

The number of tests planned for this suite. Undefined if no plans were made.

=head2 C<skip-message>

If suite is planned for skipping then this is the message as for C<skip-remaining> tool:

=begin code :lang<raku>
subtest "Conditional test" => {
    plan |($condition ?? :skip-all('makes no sens because ...') !! Empty);
    pass "dummy test";
}
=end code

Otherwise undefined.

B<NOTE!> Any examples of code in this documentation are based on the default
L<C<Test::Async::Base>|rakudoc:Test::Async::Base>
bundle.

=head2 C<TODO-message>

If suite is planned for I<TODO> then this is the message as for any of C<todo> test tools.

=head2 C<TODO-count>

A number of remaining I<TODO> tests:

=begin code :lang<raku>
todo "To be done yet...", 3;
pass  "test 1";
# -> test-suite.TODO-count == 2 at this point
flunk "test 2";
pass  "test 3";
=end code

Could be set to C<Inf> meaning all remaining tests are to be I<TODO>-marked.

=head2 C<nesting>

How deep are we from the top suite? I.e. a child of a child of the top suite will have nesting 2.

=head2 C<nesting-prefix>

A string, recommended prefix to be used for indenting messages produced by the suite.

=head2 C<suite-caller>

An instance of
L<C<Test::Async::Hub::ToolCallerCtx>|rakudoc:Test::Async::Hub::ToolCallerCtx>.
Keeps information about the location where the suite was created.

=head2 C<transparent>

A flag. If I<True> then this suite will have its call location set to the where it's enclosing test tool or suite
are called. C<subtest> implementation by
L<C<Test::Async::Base>|rakudoc:Test::Async::Base>
uses this for C<:hidden> mode of operation.

This attribute is propagated to child suites instantiated using C<create-suite> method. In other words, nested
suites of a transparent one will all be transparent by default.

=head2 C<is-async>

True if the suite itself or any of its parents is invoked asynchronously.

=head2 C<is-TODO>

Indicates if the whole suite has been marked as I<TODO>. This makes difference between:

=begin code :lang<raku>
todo "Later...";
subtest "new feature" => { ... }
=end code

and

=begin code :lang<raku>
subtest "new feature" => {
    todo-remaining "Later...";
    ...
}
=end code

Also I<True> if C<todo> parameter of plan is set to a message, which is virtually the same as prefixing the subtest with
C<todo>.

=head2 C<parallel>

I<True> if suite is invoking children suites asynchronously.

=head2 C<random>

I<True> if suite is invoking children suites in a random order.

=head2 C<tests-run>

The counter of test tool invocations.

=head2 C<tests-failed>

The counter of failed test tools.

=head2 C<messages>

An array of message lines produced by the suite and its child suites if it is an asynchronous child. I.e. if C<is-async>
is I<True>. The messages are submitted for reporting when the suite run ends and its result is reported.

=head2 C<test-jobs>

Maximus number of concurrently running jobs allowed. Note that a I<job> is anything invoked using C<start-job> method
of L<C<Test::Async::JobMgr>|rakudoc:Test::Async::JobMgr>.

=head2 C<stage>

The current stage of suite lifecycle. See C<TestStage> enum in
L<C<Test::Async::Utils>|rakudoc:Test::Async::Utils>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<new>

Creates a new instance of constructed C<Test::Async::Suite> class. See
L<C<Test::Async::Manual>|rakudoc:Test::Async::Manual>.

=head2 C<top-suite()>

Returns a singleton – the top suite object.

=head2 C<has-top-suite()>

Returns C<True> if the top suite singleton has been instantiated already.

=head2 C<set-stage(TestStage:D $stage -> TestStage)>

Transition suite state to stage C<$stage>. Throws C<Test::Async::X::StageTransition>
(L<C<Test::Async::X>|rakudoc:Test::Async::X>) if the transition is not possible. If transitions from C<TSInitializing> to C<TSInProgress> then
the method also starts the event loop thread.

Returns the pre-transition stage.

=head2 C<multi event(Event:D)>

The ultimate handler of event objects. A bundle wishing to react to events must define a multi-candidate of this method:

=begin code :lang<raku>
test-bundle MyBundle {
    multi method event(Event::Telemetry:D $ev) {
        ...
    }
}
=end code

=head2 C<setup-from-plan>

Setup suite parameters based on a plan profile hash. If called when suite stage is not C<TSInitializing> then throws
C<Test::Async::X::PlanTooLate>.

The keys supported by profile are:

=item B<tests> - planned number of tests.
=item B<skip-all> - a string with a skip message. If set all tests are skipped as if C<skip-remaining> is used.
=item B<todo> - a string with a I<TODO> message. If set all tests and suite itself are marked as I<TODO>.
=item B<parallel> – invoke children suites asynchronously.
=item B<random> – invoke children suites randomly.
=item B<test-jobs> - set the maximum number of concurrent jobs allowed. See C<$.test-jobs>.
=item B<job-timeout> - set the timeout awaiting for jobs to complete. See C<$.job-timeout>.

=head2 C<multi plan(UInt:D $tests, *%profile)>
=head2 C<multi plan(*%profile)>

One of the only  two test tools provided by the core itself. See method C<setup-from-plan> for the profile keys allowed.

When C<plan> is invoked with positional integer parameter, this is equivalent to setting C<tests> plan profile key. In
either case, if tests are planned the method reports it by emitting `Event::Plan`.

If plan profile contains unknown keys then diagnostic event with a warning is emitted for each unknwon key.

=head2 C<done-testing()>

Just invokes C<finish> method.

=head2 C<abort-testing()>

Similar to C<done-testing> but also interrupts current test suite. If it happens to be the C<top-suite> then exits.

This tool is helpful to avoid constructs like:

=begin code :lang<raku>
if !ok($my-check-result, "...") {
    skip-rest "other tests make no sense now";
}
else {
    ... # Do all other tests
}
=end code

Such approach could be especially annoying if I<other tests> also have a case where failure must skip remaining tests.
Instead one can do:

=begin code :lang<raku>
if !ok($my-check-result, "...") {
    skip-rest "other tests make no sense now";
    abort-testing
}
... # Do more tests
if !ok($my-other-check, "...") {
    skip-rest "makes no sense to proceed";
    abort-testing
}
... # Do the rest
=end code

=head2 C<create-suite(suiteType = self.WHAT, *%c)>

Creates a child suite. C<%c> is used to pass parameters to the suite constructor method.

=head2 C<invoke-suite($suite, :$async = False, :$instant = False, Capture:D :$args=\())>

Invokes a suite as a new job. The invocation method chosen depending on the suite C<parallel> and C<random> attributes
and this method parameters. The parameters take precedence over the attributes:

=item B<C<$instant>> - start job instantly, ignore the value of C<random>.
=item B<C<$async>> - start job asynchronously always. If C<random> is in effect then job is postponed but then would
start asynchronously anyway, not matter of C<parallel>.
=item B<C<$args>> – a L<C<Capture>|https://docs.raku.org/type/Capture> which will be used to call C<$suite>'s code.

The method returns job C<Promise> of the invoked suite.

=head2 C<run(:$is-async)>

Execute the suite here and now. Internal implementation detail.

=head2 C<throw(Test::Async::X::Base:U \exType, *%c)>

Throws a L<C<Type::Async::X>|rakudoc:Type::Async::X> exception. C<%c> is used as exception constructor profile to which C<hub> named parameter
is added.

=head2 C<abort>

Results in quick suite shutdown via bypassing all remaining suite code and invoking method C<dismiss>.

=head2 C<send-command(Event::Command:U \evType, |c)>

Sends a command message event. The C<c> capture is passed with the event object and is used as parameters of the command
handling method.

=head2 C<multi send-test(Event::Test:U \evType, Str:D $message, TestResult:D $test-result, *%event-profile --> Bool:D)>
=head2 C<multi send-test(Event::Test:U \evType, Str:D $message, TestResult:D $test-result, %event-profile, Bool :$bypass-todo --> Bool:D)>

Creates an event of type C<evType> and emits it. This is I<the> method to be used for emitting C<Event::Test>.

`send-test` does the following:

=item counts tests, including total runs and failures
=item marks a test as I<TODO> unless `:bypass-todo` argument is given (see C<take-TODO> method)
=item sets test number
=item sets event's C<caller> attribute

=head2 C<send-plan(UInt:D $planned, :$on-start)>

Emits C<Event::Plan> event. If C<$on-start> is I<True> and suite is the topmost one with C<skip-all> passed in plan
profile – in other words, if topmost suite is planned for skipping; – then instead of emitting the event by standard
means, hands it over directly to C<report-event> method and instantly exits the program with 0 exit code.

=head2 C<normalize-message(+@message --> Seq)>

Takes a free-form message possibly passed in in many chunks, splits it into lines and appends a new line to each
individual line. This is the I<normal form> of a message.
L<C<Test::Async::Reporter::TAP>|rakudoc:Test::Async::Reporter::TAP>
expects children suite messages to come in normalized form.

I<NOTE.> This form is chosen as I<normal> because TAP is a line-based protocol for which a line must end with a newline.

=head2 C<send-message(+@message)>

This method takes a message, normalizes it, and then choses which output channel it is to be directed to:

= if suite is not the topmost one and it its C<$.is-async> is I<True> then message is collected in C<@.messages> to be
later passed to the parent suite with a test event.
= otherwise the message is passed to C<method-to-console> method.

=head2 C<multi proclaim(Test::Async::Result:D $result, Str:D $message, *%c --> Bool:D)>
=head2 C<multi proclaim(Bool $cond, Str:D $message, %event-profile, *%c --> Bool:D)>

This is the main method to emit a test event depending on test outcome passed in C<$cond> or C<$result.cond>. The method
sets event C<origin> to the invoking object, sets event's object C<@.messages> and C<$.nesting>. C<%event-profile> is
what the user wants to pass to C<Event::Test> constructor. C<%c> capture is bypassed to `send-test` method as-is.

=head2 C<next-test-id>

Returns the next available test number. This is the number one sees next to test outcome status:

=begin code
    ok 2 - message
       ^
       +--- this is it!
=end code

=head2 C<take-TODO(--> Str)>

If suit has a I<TODO> in effect, i.e. C<$.is-TODO> is I<True> or C<$!TODO-count> is greater than 0, then this method
will return the current C<$.TODO-message>. The C<$.TODO-count> will be reduced if necessary.

=head2 C<set-todo(Str:D $message, Int:D $count)>

Emits C<Event::Cmd::SetTODO>.

=head2 C<sync-events()>

It's almost no-op method call with a side effect of making sure that all events emitted prior to this method call are
processed. The method works by emitting C<Event::Cmd::SyncEvents> with a C<Promise::Vow> parameter and awaits until
C<cmd-syncevents> command handler keeps the vow. Because events are queued, this ensures that by the moment when the vow
is kept all earlier events in the queue were pulled and handled.

=head2 C<await-jobs()>

This method implements two tasks:

=item first, it pulls postponed jobs and invokes them in a random order
=item next it calls C<await-all-jobs> to make sure all jobs have completed
=item if C<await-all-jobs> doesn't finish in 30 seconds C<Test::Async::X::AwaitTimeout> is thrown

=head2 C<finish(:$now = False)>

This is the finalizing method. When suite ends, it invokes this method to take care of postponed jobs, report a plan
if not reported at suite start (i.e. number of planned tests wasn't set), and emits C<Event::DoneTesting> and
C<Event::Terminate>.

While performing these steps the method transition from C<TSFinishing> stage, to C<TSFinished>, and then calls method
C<dismiss>.

With C<:now> the method ignores any postponed job and proceeds as if none were started. This is a kind of an emergency
hatch for cases where we have good reasons to suspect a stuck job.

=head2 C<dismiss>

Transition suite to C<TSDismissed> stage and emits C<Event::Terminate>. After that it awaits for the event to be handled
by the event loop.

=head2 C<measure-telemetry(&code, Capture:D \c = \())>

This method is for the future implementation and doesn't really do anything useful now.

=head2 C<tool-factory(--> Seq)>

Produces a sequence of C<'&tool-name' => &tool-code> pairs suitable for use with C<sub EXPORT>. Internal implementation
detail.

=head2 C<locate-tool-caller(Int:D $pre-skip, Bool:D :$anchored --> ToolCallerCtx:D)>

Finds the context in which the current test tool is invoked and returns a
L<C<Test::Async::Hub::ToolCallerCtx>|rakudoc:Test::Async::Hub::ToolCallerCtx>
instance or a L<C<Failure>|https://docs.raku.org/type/Failure> in case of an error.

C<$pre-skip> defines the number of frames to be skipped before the method starts looking for the real call location.
The value must be relative to the frame where the method is called.

=head3 C<push-tool-caller(ToolCallerCtx:D $ctx)>

Pushes a new call location on tool call stack.

=head3 C<pop-tool-caller(--> ToolCallerCtx:D)>

Pops a call location from tool call stack. Returns L<C<Failure>|https://docs.raku.org/type/Failure> if the stack is empty.

=head2 C<tool-caller(--> ToolCallerCtx:D)>

Returns the topmost call location on the tool call stack or a L<C<Failure>|https://docs.raku.org/type/Failure> if the stack is empty.

=head3 C<jobify-tool(&code)>

This method makes sure that a test tool is invoked in
L<C<Test::Async::JobMgr>|rakudoc:Test::Async::JobMgr>
environment. Normaly it is expected that tools are called from within threads created by the job manager. But sometimes
this condition cannot be fulfilled. For example:

=begin code :lang<raku>
$object.method-returns-promise.then: -> $p { is $p.result, $expected, "promise completed as expected" };
=end code

C<then> code here is likely to be invoked in a thread created elsewhere without a chance for us to take over the
process. This method wraps a test tool code into a job if it detects that the current thread is different from the
suite's thread and there is not `$*TEST-SUITE` variable which is always set for us by the job manager.

=head2 C<anchor(&code)>, C<anchor(Int:D $pre-skip, &code)>

This method sets anchor location (see
L<C<Type::Async::Manual>|https://modules.raku.org/dist/Type::Async::Manual>
Call Location And Anchoring section) for all nested test suits or calls to test tools, done within C<&code>.
For example:

=begin code :lang<raku>
method my-compound-tool(...) is test-tool(:!wrap) {
    self.anchor: {
        subtest "compound subtest", :hidden, {
            my-other-compound-tool(...);
        }
    }
}
=end code

In the example the subtest and any nested tools/suits used by C<my-other-compound-tool> will report the location where
C<my-compound-tool> is called.

=head2 C<temp-file(Str:D $base-name, $data --> Str:D)>

Quickly create a temporary file and populate it with $data. Returns absolute file name. Throws
C<Test::Async::X::FileCreate>/C<Test::Async::X::FileClose> in case of errors.
