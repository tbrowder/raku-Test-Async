=NAME

C<Test::Async::Metamodel::BundleClassHOW> - metaclass backing custom bundle classes.

=DESCRIPTION

This class purpose is to ensure that test tool methods are wrapped into common boilerplate. The boilerplate does
the following:

=item determines calling context to make sure any error reported points at user code where the test tool is invoked.
As a result it sets C<tool-caller> and C<caller-ctx> attributes of the current suite object.
=item validates if current suite stage allows test tool invokation
=item tries to transition the suite into C<TSInProgress> stage if tool method object has `$.readify` set (see
L<C<Test::Async::TestTool>|../TestTool.md>
=item emits C<Event::Skip> if tool method has its C<$.skippable> set and suite's C<$.skip-message> is defined.
=item otherwise invokes the original test tool method code.

Wrapping doesn't replace the method object itself.

If test tool method object has its C<wrappable> attribute set to I<False> then wrapping doesn't take place. In this case
the method must take care of all necessary preparations itself. See implementation of C<subtest> by
L<C<Test::Async::Base>|../Base.md> for example.
