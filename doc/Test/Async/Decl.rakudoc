=NAME
C<Test::Async::Decl> - declarations for writing new bundles

=SYNOPSIS
    use Test::Async::Decl;

    unit test-bundle MyBundle;

    method my-tool(...) is test-tool(:name<mytool>, :!skippable, :!readify) {
        ...
    }

=DESCRIPTION
This module exports declarations needed to write custom bundles for C<Test::Async> framework.

=head2 C<test-bundle>

Declares a bundle role backed by
L<C<Test::Async::Metamodel::BundleHOW>|rakudoc:Test::Async::Metamodel::BundleHOW>
metaclass.

=head2 C<test-reporter>

Declares a bundle role wishing to act as a reporter. Backed by
L<C<Test::Async::Metamodel::ReporterHOW>|rakudoc:Test::Async::Metamodel::ReporterHOW>
metaclass. The bundle also consumes
L<C<Test::Async::Reporter>|rakudoc:Test::Async::Reporter>
role.

=head2 C<test-hub>

This kind of package creates a hub class which is backed by
L<C<Test::Async::Metamodel::HubHOW>|rakudoc:Test::Async::Metamodel::HubHOW>
metaclass. Barely useful for a third-party developer.

=head2 C<&trait_mod:<is>(Method:D \meth, :$test-tool!)>

This trait is used to declare a method in a bundle as a test tool:

    method foo(...) is test-tool {
        ...
    }

The method is then exported to user as C<&foo> routine. Internally the method is getting wrapped into a code which
does necessary preparations for the tool to act as expected. See
L<C<Test::Async::Metamodel::BundleClassHOW>|rakudoc:Test::Async::Metamodel::BundleClassHOW>
for more details.

The following named parameters are accepted by the trait:

=item C<tool-name> aka C<name>
=item C<skippable> aka C<skip>
=item C<readify>
=item C<wrappable> aka C<wrap>

They correspond to same-named attributes of
L<C<Test::Async::TestTool>|rakudoc:Test::Async::TestTool>.
By default C<skippable>, C<readify>, and C<wrappable> are set to I<True>. Thus it rather makes sense to negate them, as
shown in the L<#SYNOPSIS>.
