L<C<Test::Async::Base>|rakudoc:Test::Async::Base>.
=item C<CallFrame:D $.caller>, required – position in user code where the test was called.
=item C<@.child-messages> – messages from child suites. Each entry should be a single line ending with newline.
=item C<@.comments> – comments for the test. Normally expected to be reported with C<diag>. Not special formatting
=item C<@.pre-comments> - similar to the above, but these will preceed the main test message
