=head1 Class C<Event::Test>

Is L<C<Event::Report>|https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Test-Async/blob/v0.1.0/docs/md/Test/Async/Event/Report.md>.

Base class for events reporting test outcomes.

=head3 Attributes

=item C<Str $.todo> – message to use if test is marked as I<TODO>.
=item C<Str $.flunks> – message to use if test is marked as anticipated failure (see C<test-flunks> in
L<C<Test::Async::Base>|https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Test-Async/blob/v0.1.0/docs/md/Test/Async/Base.md>.
=item C<CallFrame:D $.caller>, required – position in user code where the test was called.
=item C<@.child-messages> – messages from child suites. Each entry should be a single line ending with newline.
=item C<@.comments> – comments for the test. Normally expected to be reported with C<diag>. Not special formatting
=item C<@.pre-comments> - similar to the above, but these will preceed the main test message
requirements except for a recommendation for the last line not to end with a newline.
